# WeatherSniffer
Like most outdoor activities, the weather dictates how motivated we are to leave the house. Walking a dog is no different.
Unlike other pets, dogs have to be taken for regular walks or their health can deteriorate.
WeatherSniffer not only shows the weather but informs a user whether now is a suitable time to walk your dog.
