# Weather APP PLACEHOLDER NAME
Like most outdoor activities, the weather dictates how motivated we are to make the extra effort and walking the dog is no different.
Unlike other pets, dogs have to be taken for regular walks or their health can decline.
This weather application not only shows the weather but also tells the owner a suitable time to take their beloved dog out for a walk.
